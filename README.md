# Juno PM

> An AI Associate PM that turns escalations from tickets (Jira & support) & Slack into strategic insights and creation of draft PRD

This repo is my final project for the AI Product Management Certification — **Juno PM**. Each module’s artefact lives in its own folder; this README is the dashboard and the pitch.

## PM Execution Plan

### Where Juno is today
- M1–M6 specced and committed.
- The prototype validates the M1 flow with the team.
- Basic Juno pipeline: read strategy doc → extract insights via Claude → write to roadmap
- User-facing UI for browsing insights, approving writes
- Tool tracing/logging 
- Initial anti-pattern detection logic
- Human rubric drafted; 2 grader candidates lined up; no calibration round yet.

### What ships next (next 2 sprints)
- Sprint 1: wire the eval harness to CI; staff and calibrate 2 graders; ship the dashboard tool.
- Sprint 2: open closed beta with 3 PMs (1 RocketShip, 2 customers); weekly rubric review; instrument abandon-rate.

### What I watch (dashboards)
- Daily: thumbs-down rate, regen rate, hand-off rate.
- Weekly: human-rubric mean per dimension; refusal hit-rate; cost per run, engagement patterns, sentiment in chat/Slack.
- Per release: golden-set accuracy; format/citation/refusal pass rate.

### Red lines (what blocks shipping)
- Any critical-safety fail (any "1" on safety dimension in human eval).
- golden-set accuracy on automated layer.
- Customer-name fabrication in last 30 days.
- Cost >$0.50 per run.
- P99 latency >5s on triage flow.

### Governance
- Compliance: PII scrubber pre-LLM; GDPR DSR handler in /docs/dsr-runbook.md.
- Safety: prompt-injection eval row in golden set; refusal on legal/contract content.
- Reliability: 99.5% SLO; cached top-3 fallback if model is down.
- Reputation: 2-hour incident-response playbook in /docs; canary deploys for every model swap.

## Build Insights

- **Friction point.** Retrieval quality was the bottleneck — chunking strategy mattered more than the model.
- **Key learning.** Eval rubrics force the product decisions that PRDs let you hide.
- **Aha moment.** The system prompt is the product — the UI is the wrapper.
